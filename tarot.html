					<h2>Regina Olson</h2>	
					
					<p>I’m Regina Olson, Intuitive Tarot Reader, Astrology Student, YouTube Reader, and owner of Tarot in Thyme.

					<br><br>I use a blend of Tarot and Astrology, along with my intuition to deliver messages to you to help you shift your current situation. My goal is to get to the heart of the matter and provide you with a piece of information that can help 1unlock many doors for you. 

					<br><br>Growing up as a Jehovah's Witness, my relationship with God was based in fear because the God I knew was an angry God. I spent years trying to find my way and during that time, I learned to release the fear and to focus on love. Tarot in Thyme is the "baby" born from this journey of self-discovery. 

					<br><br>I have studied with with renowned Tarot Master Sheilaa Hite, and was awarded a Certified Professional Tarot Consultant and Tarot Master Certificate. I am currently at Level 6 Astrology mastery. 

					<br><br>In addition to Intuitive Tarot Readings, Regina’s signature offerings are:
						<br><br>
					- Tarot &amp; Astrology Reading
						<br>
					- Tarot &amp; Essential Oils
						<br>
					- Custom Essential Oil Blend with Mantra

					<br><br>Regina is available for virtual sessions via Zoom as well as in-person sessions at Tarot in Thyme in Kent, CT and at The Mayflower Inn in Washington, CT.
